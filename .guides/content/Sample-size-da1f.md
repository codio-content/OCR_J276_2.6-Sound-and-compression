This is also known as the **bit depth** and describes the number of bits used to encode each sample â€“ similar to the colour depth in images.

Using more bits enables the range of the sound to be more accurately represented.
The dynamic range is the range of volumes of sound in the music:

- Using 8 bits allows 256 gradations to be measured, 
- 16 bits allows 65,536 and 
- 24 bits allows 16.7 million. 

Therefore using more bits allows for much smaller gradations in the volume.
16 bits is used for CD recording.
