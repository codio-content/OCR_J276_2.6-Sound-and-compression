Files, especially graphic and audio files can become very large and millions are uploaded, downloaded and streamed every day. 
When they are uploaded to social networking sites they have to be stored in huge data centres.

File compression reduces the file size and gives the benefits such as:

- It uses less internet bandwidth when they are downloaded.
- Transfer speed is quicker.
- It takes up less storage space on the servers of ‘cloud storage’ providers.
- Smaller files reduce congestion on the internet, which is good for everyone.
- It makes audio and video files suitable for streaming.

Compression algorithms are used to ensure that the file size is as small as possible.
