Sound is caused by vibrations travelling through a medium such as air, water or metal. These vibrations compress and then pull apart the air molecules so causing changes in air pressure.

If these vibrations enter our ears and cause tiny sensory hairs to vibrate, then we can hear the sound.

The vibrations travel out in waves – sound waves.

The graphs show that there are continuous changes in the air pressure and recording methods that try to capture these continuous changes by representing  them as changes in electrical voltage are called **analogue**.

Analogue recording therefore capture the complete sound waves.

Computer, however, are digital and they cannot represent continuous, minute changes in voltage – their transistor are either on or off, with noting in between. They are digital and not analogue.

Therefore snapshots of the sound wave must be taken and then fitted together. 

This is called **sampling** and each snapshot is called a **sound sample**.
