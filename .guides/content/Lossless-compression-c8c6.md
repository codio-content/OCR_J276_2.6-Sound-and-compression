Lossless compression algorithms reduce file sizes without deleting any data.
Lossless compression looks for redundancy, where the same data is stored many times, and groups this data into one reference in the file.
When the file is decompressed, it is exactly the same as the original. Nothing is lost.

It is very successful at reducing the sizes of files where there is limited variation in the data such as text files or graphic files with low colour depth.

Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) and Apple Lossless (ALAC) are becoming popular for the lossless compression of audio files.
These audio formats can reduce the size of an uncompressed file by about 50% - less than MP3- but they are becoming more popular on downloading websites for people who prioritise sound quality over small file size.
