Lossless compression algorithms reduce file sizes without deleting any data.
Lossless compression looks for redundancy, where the same data is stored many times, and groups this data into one reference in the file.
When the fi le is decompressed, it is exactly the same as the original. Nothing is lost.

It is very successful at reducing the sizes of files where there is limited variation in the data such as text files or graphic files with low colour depth.

Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) and Apple Lossless (ALAC) are becoming popular for the lossless compression of audio files.
These audio formats can reduce the size of an uncompressed file by about 50% - less than MP3- but they are becoming more popular on downloading websites for people who prioritise sound quality over small file size.
