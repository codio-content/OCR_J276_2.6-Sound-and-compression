Lossy compression decreases the file size by discarding some of the data and the original can never be reconstituted. It has been irreversibly changed. That is why it cannot be used for text files or program files â€“ a book with lots of missing words would be unreadable!

But it can be used for graphic and audio files as they contain lots of data that can be discarded. During lossy compression, the algorithm analyses the image or sound and finds areas where there are only slight differences that we might not be able to distinguish.  It will then give these the same value and so can rewrite the file using fewer bits.

Lossless algorithms include MP3 for audio and JPG for image files.
An MP3 file is usually about one tenth of the size of an uncompressed file, so more files can
be stored on discs and SD cards.
