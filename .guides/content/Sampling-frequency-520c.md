This is the number of samples taken each second. The higher the frequency, the more accurately the sound will be represented.

The image shows the effect of different sampling frequencies.
The low sample frequency at the top misses out lots of changes in the wave and produces a poor representation.
The high sample rate below produces a more accurate representation of the original sound wave.


For CDs, a sampling rate of 44,100 per second (44.1 KHz) is used and 96,000 KHz for Blu-ray audio.
