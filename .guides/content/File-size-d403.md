The size of a sound file is given by the formula:

**Sampling frequency * sample size (bit depth) * length of recording (in seconds)**

For a 3 minute recording with a sampling frequency of 44.1 KHz and a sample size of 16 bits the file size is:

180 (3 minutes) * 44,100 (44.1 KHz) * 16 = 127, 008,000 bits
= 15876000 bytes
= 15, 876 kilobytes
= 15.9 megabytes
